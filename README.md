# Elemental-Tower-Defense
Simple "Tower Defense" game created by using Java for CS102 Project.

You can try the game out by simply running the "Main.java" file that is in the "src" file.
You may run the game buy clicking on "Elemental Tower Defense.jar" file (I did not have a chance to try this feature on other computers, it may not work).

Correction of "How To Play"
      1) Select the tower you want to place by clicking the tower in from right side of the screen.
      2) Place the tower to any green tile you want.
      3) Killing enemies will make you gain gold to place another tower or upgrade the towers.
            - You can upgrade towers by clicking the "Upgrade" button from the right and click the tower you want to upgrade afterwards.
      4) Different tower types deals different amount of damage to enemies (varies to enemy's type as well).
            -Water Tower: Deals more damage to fire type enemy, deals less damage to poison type enemy.
            -Fire Tower: Deals more damage to earth type enemy, deals less damage to water type enemy.
            -Electric Tower: Deals more damage to water type enemy, deals less damage to earth type enemy.
